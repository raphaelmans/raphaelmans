# Service Layer Testability Standard

> Canonical testing standard for controller/usecase/service/repository layers.

## Folder Structure: `__tests__` Mirror Layout

All test files live in `src/__tests__/` and mirror the source tree exactly.
Never colocate test files next to source files.

```text
src/
  __tests__/
    lib/
      modules/
        <module>/
          <module>.controller.test.ts   # input validation, error mapping
          <module>.service.test.ts      # domain rules, SRP behavior
          <module>.repository.test.ts   # persistence contract, query semantics
          <module>.usecase.test.ts      # orchestration (if usecase layer present)
          shared/
            domain.test.ts              # shared pure domain rules
      shared/
        infra/
          http/
            error-handler.test.ts
```

Navigation rule: `src/lib/modules/<module>/<module>.service.ts` → `src/__tests__/lib/modules/<module>/<module>.service.test.ts`.

## Architecture Flow (Canonical)

The server flow is:

`controller -> usecase (optional) -> service -> repository`

Where:

- `controller` handles transport concerns
- `usecase` is optional and only used for complex orchestration/side effects
- `service` owns SRP domain logic
- `repository` owns persistence logic

## MUST Rules

These are mandatory for new and modified modules.

- Dependencies across service/usecase/repository boundaries MUST be interface-based.
- Constructors in service and usecase classes MUST accept interface types, not concrete classes.
- Each module MUST have layer-appropriate tests for all implemented layers.
- Test doubles MUST be used at boundaries to keep layer tests isolated and deterministic.
- External/provider boundaries MUST include contract/regression tests with fixtures where applicable.

## TDD Behavioral Testing with Stubbed Boundaries

Service-layer development MUST follow red-green-refactor with vertical slices:

- RED: write one failing behavior test at the owning layer boundary.
- GREEN: implement the minimum change needed to pass that test.
- REFACTOR: improve structure only after GREEN while preserving existing behavior assertions.

Execution rules:

- New or changed behavior MUST start with a failing test in the owning layer (`controller`, `usecase`, `service`, or `repository`).
- Tests MUST assert behavior through public layer interfaces/service functions, not private methods.
- Tests in this phase MUST remain deterministic and offline by stubbing external boundaries (for example Supabase) via test doubles.
- Tests MUST NOT depend on live external infrastructure (live DB/server/provider) in the development loop.
- Internal call-count/order assertions SHOULD be avoided unless ordering is itself the behavior under test.
- Bug fixes MUST start with a failing regression test/fixture before implementation.
- Horizontal slicing (all tests first, all code later) MUST NOT be used.

## Required Test Matrix

| Layer | Required tests | Typical doubles |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Controller/Router | input validation, envelope/error mapping, boundary auth/rate-limit behavior | stubs/fakes for downstream calls |
| Use Case (if present) | orchestration sequence, transaction boundaries, side effects order | spies/mocks for service interfaces |
| Service | domain rules, SRP behavior, null/not-found semantics, transaction participation decisions | fakes/stubs for repositories + tx manager |
| Repository | query/persistence contract, transaction context handling, null behavior | integration harness or DB test doubles |

## Test Doubles Policy (Global)

Use these definitions consistently across server modules:

- **Stub**: fixed response
- **Spy**: records calls for assertions
- **Mock**: strict call expectations
- **Fake**: simplified working implementation (often in-memory)

Default preference:

1. fixtures + fakes/stubs
2. spies for interaction checks
3. mocks only when strict interaction verification is necessary

## Fixtures + Regression Policy

For boundary contracts (transport/provider/adapter payloads), maintain fixtures:

- `golden` (representative valid sample)
- `minimal` (smallest valid sample)
- `invalid-*` (expected failures)

Bugfix rule:

- each bug fix MUST add/adjust a fixture or test case that would have caught the bug.

## Contract Testing Scope

Contract/regression tests are REQUIRED when modules cross unstable boundaries, including:

- external payload contracts (for example webhook/provider payloads)
- adapter contracts (storage/auth/transport boundaries)
- scheduler/cron route boundary contracts
- rate-limit and auth enforcement boundaries

## Dual-Transport Parity (tRPC + OpenAPI)

When a capability is exposed in both transports during migration, parity tests are REQUIRED.

- Same input validation semantics
- Same business outcome semantics
- Same error category/code semantics
- Same auth/rate-limit boundary semantics

See `../runtime/nodejs/libraries/openapi/parity-testing.md`.

## Profile Endpoint Test Visualization

Create profile is orchestration-heavy and should be tested through a use case boundary.

```text
create profile path

controller/router (tRPC or OpenAPI)
  -> CreateProfileUseCase
      -> UserService (resolve/validate user.userId)
      -> ProfileService
          -> ProfileRepository
```

Update profile is single-service and should be tested as controller->service path.

```text
update profile path

controller/router (tRPC or OpenAPI)
  -> ProfileService
      -> ProfileRepository
```

Recommended test split:

- `CreateProfileUseCase` unit tests: orchestration order, tx boundary, user dependency behavior
- `ProfileService` unit tests: update rules and repository interaction
- transport adapter tests: input/error mapping for each endpoint/procedure

## Layer-Specific Guidance

### Controller/Router

- Test request parsing and schema validation paths.
- Test known domain errors and unknown errors map to correct response contracts.
- Do not test business rules here; stub downstream service/usecase.

**Concrete Pattern: `createCaller` + Factory Mock**

Router tests use `vi.mock` at the module level to replace factory functions, then invoke procedures via `createCaller`:

```typescript
vi.mock("@/modules/reservation/factories/reservation.factory", () => ({
  makeReservationService: vi.fn(),
  makeProfileService: vi.fn(),
}));

describe("reservationRouter", () => {
  it("returns reservation on success", async () => {
    // Arrange
    const fakeContext = createFakeContext({ userId: "user-1" });
    const caller = reservationRouter.createCaller(fakeContext);
    const reservationServiceStub = {
      findById: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue(mockReservation),
    } as Pick<IReservationService, "findById">;
    vi.mocked(makeReservationService).mockReturnValue(
      reservationServiceStub as IReservationService,
    );

    // Act
    const result = await caller.getById({ id: "res-1" });

    // Assert
    expect(result).toEqual(expect.objectContaining({ id: "res-1" }));
  });
});
```

Rules:
- Mock factory functions, not service constructors
- Use `createCaller(fakeContext)` to invoke procedures without HTTP
- Assert both success responses and error handler mapping

### Use Case

- Verify orchestration decisions, call ordering, and side-effect timing.
- Verify transaction scope boundaries (inside vs outside tx work).
- Use service interface doubles; no DB/network dependencies in usecase unit tests.

### Service

- Test pure domain rules and branching.
- Test behavior with repository returning null/conflict/existing states.
- Test transaction participation (`ctx.tx` path) vs self-owned transactions.

**Concrete Pattern: Harness Factory**

Service tests use a `createHarness()` function that wires up all dependencies as stubs:

```typescript
function createHarness(overrides?: Partial<HarnessOptions>) {
  const reservationRepo = {
    findById: vi.fn(),
    create: vi.fn(),
    update: vi.fn(),
    ...overrides?.reservationRepo,
  };
  const transactionManager = {
    run: vi.fn((fn) => fn({})),
    ...overrides?.transactionManager,
  };

  const service = new ReservationService(
    reservationRepo as IReservationRepository,
    transactionManager as TransactionManager,
  );

  return { service, reservationRepo, transactionManager };
}
```

This provides typed partial stubs for all repository dependencies without touching the DB. Helper functions like `toEntityRecord(partial)` construct test entity records from partial data typed against real schema types.

### Repository

- Validate persistence semantics and query filters.
- Validate `ctx.tx` vs base client usage.
- Keep domain rule assertions out of repository tests.

## Anti-Patterns

- Over-mocking internals instead of asserting behavior
- Testing service logic through controller tests only
- Skipping fixtures for unstable boundary contracts
- Using concrete class dependencies that block isolated unit tests
- Asserting fragile log message strings instead of structured fields
- Horizontal slicing (bulk test writing followed by bulk implementation) instead of one behavior per red-green loop
