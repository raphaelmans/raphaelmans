# Next.js Documentation

> Next.js-specific conventions layered on top of `client/core/` and `client/frameworks/reactjs/`.

This section focuses on App Router patterns, routing/params, SSR/RSC considerations, server-side auth guarding, and backend IO adapters used by React features (tRPC and/or route-handler HTTP clients).
