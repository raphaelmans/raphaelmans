# Client Core README (Agnostic)

This folder is the canonical client base.
Framework docs must implement these contracts, not replace them.

## Start Here (New Project)

Use this order for a new project or contributor onboarding:

1. `client/core/onboarding.md`
2. `client/core/architecture.md`
3. `client/core/conventions.md`
4. `client/core/folder-structure.md`
5. `client/core/client-api-architecture.md`
6. `client/core/server-state-tanstack-query.md`
7. `client/core/error-handling.md`
8. `client/core/logging.md`
9. `client/core/testing.md`
10. `client/core/testing-vitest.md`

Then read framework details:

- ReactJS: [client/frameworks/reactjs/README.md](../frameworks/reactjs/README.md)
- Next.js: [client/frameworks/reactjs/metaframeworks/nextjs/README.md](../frameworks/reactjs/metaframeworks/nextjs/README.md)

## Key Decisions (Defaults)

- Query keys follow an explicit split: direct tRPC hooks use generated `@trpc/react-query` keys/utils, `IFeatureApi` wrappers may use `buildTrpcQueryKey` for interop, and non-tRPC adapters use plain key objects in `src/common/query-keys/*`.
- Errors normalize from `unknown` to `AppError`; UI branches on `AppError.kind`, not transport-specific shapes.
- Toast usage is facade-first; feature code should not import toast providers directly.
- Client logging uses `debug` through `src/common/logging/*` (dev default with break-glass override).
- Feature APIs use `I<Feature>Api` + `class <Feature>Api` + `create<Feature>Api` for testable boundaries.
- Domain transforms use precedence: `src/lib/modules/<module>/shared/*` first, then `src/features/<feature>/*`.

## Common Mistakes

- Putting HTTP or tRPC calls directly in presentation components.
- Mixing cache invalidation logic into route/presentation layers.
- Creating feature state stores for server data that should stay in query cache.
- Copying patterns from `legacy/client/*` as if canonical.

Rule:

- New and modified files follow core contracts.
- Legacy files can migrate incrementally.
